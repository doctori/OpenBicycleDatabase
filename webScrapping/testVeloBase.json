The \"TWIN-AXLE System\" is \r\nan articulation of the geometry of the derailleur which combines two \r\nmovements to move the jockey cage across the freewheel while keeping it \r\nequidistant from all the cogs regardless of how big or how small they \r\nare in diameter.", "\r\n", "\r\nThe \"TWIN-AXLE System\" of this new derailleur works in this way: when \r\nthe gear cable is pulled the derailleur rotates on its pivot bolt (fig. \r\nA) causing the jockey cage to alter itself to suit the increasing \r\ndiameters of the freewheel cogs. At the same time, a rigid, stainless \r\nsteel arm on the diagonal of the parallelogram moves the cage plate \r\nalong the freewheel (fig. B) guiding the chain from one cog to another. \r\nThe movement of the parallelogram is controlled by a return spring. This\r\n spring is not, however, preloaded like on other derailleurs which can \r\ncause needless friction. Thanks to the elimination of friction at this \r\npoint the derailleur's shifting action is much lighter and smoother than\r\n other gear changers.", "\r\n", "\r\nThe \"TWIN-AXLE System\" of the CROCE D'AUNE derailleur is a new \r\nbreak-through in derailleur technology and is destined to set new \r\nstandards for competition derailleurs.  In races like the Giro d'ltalia \r\nand Tour de France where steep mountain roads torture both man and \r\nmachine it is extremely important for the derailleur to perform \r\nflawlessly because one missed shift or slipped chain can be the \r\ndifference between winning and loosing.

He notes that some Simplex d\u00e8railleurs had this feature on them.

The Unica-Nitor brand was purchased by Cinelli in the late 50's or early 60's, but Cinelli kept the Unica-Nitor branding on the saddles, as the covered models were very popular. If you have one of those with a torn or worn-out cover, you can remove the cover and padding and underneath it (at least on the 60's models) you will find one of these Unica-Nitor 50 saddles, complete with logo. The model shown in the pic has been lightened substantially by installing a hollow manganese-tubed seat-rail assembly made by Harlan Meyer (Hi-E Incorporated of Nashville TN).

Ripet had previously built hubs (and bottom brackets, both used first by Lyon constructeur Reyhand) himself, and apparently licensed the design to the fellow Lyon company V\u00e9ga, which built hubs as well. All 3 brands (Maxi, C.A.R., and V\u00e9ga) were produced in both alloy and steel, and were used on almost all the bikes in the touring technical trials - they were simply the best hubs available. C.A.R. hubs were first used by the French \"constructeur\" salon Reyhand, considered to be a premier artisian builder of the pre-war years. In around 1946, the first Maxi-C.A.R. hubs appeared, produced by the maker of Maxi, E. Depalle, from St. Etienne."]},

The uncommon reinforced arm pivot design looks like this would increase the brake's rigidity/reduce flexing whilst braking, and cosmetically is a nice change from the norm, with the brake having a cleaner and beefier look than most. However, it also seems that this design has necessitated the pivot spring design to be out of the ordinary too- it's one where basically the spring is only held in place by friction, unlike most other centre pull brakes, so has the potential to fall off in the road (indeed, the pair I have had two of these springs missing, and I've had to manufacture the replacements you can see in the pics!)- which would seem to bear out my above idea that the brake wasn't produced for too long.\u00a0"]},

This Dura-Ace model is different to the other Octalink designs due to it not being a self contained unit but having bearing cups and axle that can be disassembled. Both ball and roller bearings are used, and are user replaceable, along with the axle's bearing races, making this a cost effective design in the long term, compared to the above disposable models. The unit's axle is also different in colour to those of the other Octalinks which would suggest a lighter metal used- helping towards the unit's light weight. Seems a pity Shimano didn't filter the replaceable parts/disassembly technology down to the other models, seeing as they're all- even Ultegra- heavy units, as well as (more importantly IMO) highly priced over the long term, in comparison."]},
